Crcle
An minimalist social network that is targeted towards people that are offering services such as hairdressers, esthetician, etc. This application is built with Ruby on Rails and TailwindCSS 

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can create a service, register and login. Eventually, the user will be able to follow each other, a client will be able to book a service, etc.


## Reflection

### Why did I start building this project? 

I wanted to solve a real-world problem that I can realistically create. My friend who is my barber is using a scheduling system that allow his client to book appointment using Instagram, but I found that it was missing some feature such as:

- Notifying clients (followers/subscribers) when new availabilities are posted

- Live chat with his clients

I also noticed that thereâ€™s a lot of people like him using Instagram to promote his work. So, I wanted to create something more niche and hip.

I asked myself, is this app scalable? So here a few ideas that I want to implement in the future (no priority order):

- Plugin for Shopify/Instagram integration

- Loyalty program when appointment is booked with this app.

- Discount option

- Different payment method

- Social network:

	- Client can leave reviews/comments

	- Client can rate the service giver and vice versa

	- Service giver can announce message on the platform that will inform every subscriber

Finally, I wanted to learn a different language, so I decided to work with Ruby on Rails.
